1. How do you declare a stack that holds pointers to Node structs?

#include <stack>

stack<Node> stackOfNodes; 

2. Write out the in-order, pre-order, level-order, and post-order output for the following tree

       5
      /  \
     /    \
    /      \
   2       18
  / \
-4   3      
in-order (left, curr, right):
    -4, 2, 3, 5, 18
pre-order (curr, left, right):
    5, 2, -4, 3, 18
level-order (each level):
    5, 2, 18, -4, 3
post-order (left, right, curr):
    -4, 3, 2, 18, 5


pointer to root Node

base case: if pointer is nullptr (empty true), don't print anything, return 
recursive case:
